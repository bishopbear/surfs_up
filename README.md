Overview of the statistical analysis: 
This project is going to help us understand if the average tempurate during winter and summer months will inhibit our venture from being successful in winter months. 

The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:
The results for June and December show that the weather will provide for ideal conditions for this business in both summer and winter.

Summary:
The statistics show that the main differences are that it tends to be a little cooler in the winter season.
- The average temp in December is 4 degrees cooler than June.
- The minimum temp in December is 8 degrees cooler than June.
- The std dev. is slightly higher in the winter than summer.

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 
Now that we know the tempurate will not, by istelf, inhibit the shop from being succesful we would also recommend a similar analysis for
