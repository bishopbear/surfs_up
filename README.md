The statistics show that the main differences are that it tends to be a little cooler in the winter season.
* The average temp in December is 4 degrees cooler than June.
* The minimum temp in December is 8 degrees cooler than June.

Here is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 
Now that we know the tempurate will not, by istelf, inhibit the shop from being succesful we would also recommend a similar analysis for rainy days and cloudy days.
